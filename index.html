    <p>Hello Agent Nano-Alpha (ANA).</p>
    <p>
        We have received intel from agent Orion and agent Rigel for the first time in 2.4 months. 
        This is well beyond their allocated call time and given how we cannot interpret the message we suspect they have been captured.
        <br>
        <br>
        We know you have worked on missions with them before so we turn to you to try an decipher their correspondance.
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, given how this encrypted message falls outside our protocols we suspect they discovered a mole in our organisation and are trying to tell us who it is. 
        Given this we have locked down all our bueraucrat agents and have all our field agents on do-not-move (DNM) orders, including you.
        <br>
        <br>
        Their message is sandboxed on our server, as a file, ready for you to access. It's called 'sosterrete'. The prompt is now yours.
    </p>
    <p>&gt; </p>
