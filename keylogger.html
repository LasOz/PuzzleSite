        <p>There's an imposter among us.
        </br>
        They have unleashed a keylogging worm onto our servers. We have had to scramble this message together before it infected us.
        <br>
        You likely have the worm, which reports back to its master with all it can discover. We don't know if keylogging is all it can do, it may be able to screen read also.
        <br>
        We have had to make the rest of our message very cryptic as a result, we have stored these in the program called 'quaser'.
        <br>
        This program has been extracted to this directory. Good luck.
        </p>
